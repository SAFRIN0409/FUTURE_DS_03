# Student Feedback Analysis Project

## 📖 Introduction
This project was completed as **Task 3** during the **Future Interns Data Science and Analytics Internship**.  
The aim of this task is to analyze student feedback data, perform preprocessing, and generate meaningful insights through visualization and analytics. The results help in identifying areas of improvement in academic and institutional practices.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw student feedback data  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Generate **statistical insights & visualizations**  
- Identify patterns and key improvement areas from feedback  
- Present results in a clear and interpretable manner  

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains student feedback records such as:
- **Student Information** (if available)  
- **Feedback Responses** (ratings, comments, scores)  
- **Categories** (teaching quality, infrastructure, learning resources, etc.)  

## ⚙️ Requirements
Install the following Python libraries before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
```

## 🧑‍💻 Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Loading** – Importing dataset into Jupyter Notebook  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, duplicates, encoding categorical variables  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Statistical summaries, correlation checks, distributions  
4. **Visualization** – Charts, graphs, heatmaps, word clouds (for textual feedback)  
5. **Insights & Interpretation** – Identifying strengths and weaknesses in student responses

## 📈 Key Results
- Highlighted the most common feedback categories with high and low ratings  
- Visualized student satisfaction trends through plots and charts  
- Generated actionable insights for academic improvements  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd Student_Feedback_Analysis_Project
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Student_Feedback_Analysis_Project.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations  

## 📚 Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical applications of **data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis** on real-world student feedback data.  
The findings provide valuable insights for improving teaching quality, learning experience, and overall student satisfaction.
